# FuzzyHive
Fuzzy extensions for Apache Hive

FuzzyHive library extends the Apache Hive framework with fuzzy sets-based techniques for querying, analyzing, and reporting on Big data warehouses. The fuzzy techniques, like including fuzzy filtering on dimensional attributes, projection with fuzzy transformation, fuzzy grouping, and fuzzy joining, can be used while operating on Hive-based data warehouses. These operations are embedded in Hive Query Language (HiveQL). Such extensions make Big Data warehousing more flexible and contribute to the portfolio of tools used by the community of people working with fuzzy sets and data analysis. The FuzzyHive library complements the spectrum of available solutions for fuzzy data processing and querying in large data sets.
